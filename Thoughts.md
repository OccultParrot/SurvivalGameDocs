# Ideas
Here are some gameplay mechanics I have thought of.

- ## Rope Making
You can make rope by holding atleast 9 fiber and pressing the use input and it opens a UI called "Braiding".
The brading UI shows three strands of the used fiber with a tie at the top and a propmt to press the "right" input. The left strand crosses over the middle strand, and it is now considered the middle strand.
Then you are prompted to press the "left" input, then the right strand crosses over the middle, and is now consided the middle strand.
You keep doing this till the chosen fiber is used up, which then closes the Braiding UI and gives braided rope, with the length depending on the amount of fiber used.

- ## Flint Knapping
Flint knapping is the process of hitting flint with a rock called the "Hammerstone" to break shards off the flint, called the "Workpiece". These shards are sharp and can be used to make small game arrowheads.
By knapping the shards off the workpiece you can refine the shape till you reach the correct shape. I don't know if this is how it will be done, because it seems difficult to code, but we will see.
