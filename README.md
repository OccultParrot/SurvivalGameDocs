# The project...

The idea for the project is an extremely indepth survival game, in a 2D point of view. As of right now I am the only person actually working on development, but that may change in the future. A large insperation for this project is TerraFirmaCraft+, which is a Minecraft mod that completely overhauls the games survival aspect, but I just really love the complexity of the mod and I want to have the players of my game get that same experiance.

## Features

As of right now I don't have much in the game, because I am working on some basic world generation right now. I have been writting ideas for game mechanics in my ["Thoughts"](Thoughts.md) file, so if you are intrested you can check that file out.

## Thoughts on Monetising the Game

I don't have any plans on monetising the game right now. I plan on the game being free, because I am writting it for fun and don't really care if I am making money off it.
