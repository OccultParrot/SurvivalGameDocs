# Story Ideas
I think the games story should be divided into mulitple sections or, "Chapters"
Through the Chapters, the players will have more technology unlocked. One example of this is when the player finds a village, the player will now have the ability to make things like Mortar and Pestles and to produce things like pine tar.

The game will notify the players when a new chapter has been reached. Each chapter will have more quests for the player, from new and old NPCs.

## Basic order of Chapters
- Player runs from buring village

Very start of a new save. Mostly a cutscene.

- Player wakes up in the middle of the wilderness and is hungry

This is the start of the tutorial. This will give access to basic unknapped hand axe, and other EXTREMELY basic tools, items, and structures.

- Player finds the spirits home.

This is the end of the tutorial, and gives access to knapping, fibers, and basic rope, Along with the start of the story and quests.

More will be added soon...
